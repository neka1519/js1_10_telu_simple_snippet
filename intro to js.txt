1. Why you should Learn JavaScript Today

JS - Invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 
Js was used only for client side scrippting to enhance websites in client end
But recently Js is used even for server side and also to create desktop apps,
    andriod apps and ios also acts ike dynamic programming lang
Ex : Node.js used for dynamic programming in server sidevweb development - framework developed using JS
Ex : React js for frontend developed by FB used to creat both web and mobile apps
Ex : React Native used for mobile apps 
Ex : Angular Js - front end MVC(model, view, controller) - developed by google - now open src - 
     used to created dynamic web apps
Ex : Electron Js  - helps to build cross platform desktop apps for standlone systemss like paint, text editor, music player
EX : React VR - you can create VR apps
Ex : TensorFlow.js - open source machine learning platfrom - it's a lib that can implememnt ML applications
Js is also used for desktop app which is not web app but then standalone s/w

2. Document Object model

3 essestial parts to web development
    html - adds structure to web page - uses tags <html> <head>
            not general purpose programming lang as can't use if-else, inheritance or OOPS concept
    css  - adds styles to webpages - uses colors,bordeer,margin - enhances thw webpage
            uses ids, classes. can be given in 3 different ways - internal, inline, external
    js   -  adds programming to web page and functionality - 
            client side validation - effects and events - 
            Ex : when you click a button it opens or event is passed

How does JS understand html ?
    When you load a html Document into the browser,
    another representation corresponding to that one  is created but in 
    a different view ---> JS view
    all the tags are represented as objects in DOM
    HTML FOLLOWS a hirearchy
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>
            </title>
        </head>

        <body>
        </body>
    </html>

    even in DOM, a hirearchy is created
    DOM is needed as JS can easily interpret that rather than html tags
    Ex : if you want to change the text in title using js dom, you can easily change the attribute
    JS looks at DOM in terms of Node.
    element node  - <html> <head> <title>
    attribute node - id 
    text node  - "mytitle" (the content inisde the element)

3. First Hello World

//you don't need any servers as the latest browers(chrome or firefox) comes with a build injs 
engine or embedded in them
